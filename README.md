# SENEC collector

Collect data from SENEC Solar Battery Storage System and push it to InfluxDB 2

Allows accessing a local SENEC device (V2 + V3) as well as the SENEC cloud (V4).

## Requirements

Linux machine with Docker installed

Tested on:

- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B on Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster) and 11 (bullseye) and 12 (bookworm)
- Synology NAS DS220+ on DSM 7.1+
- ... and lots of other Linux machines - if it runs Docker, it should work

## Getting started

0. Decide if you want to use the SENEC cloud or a local SENEC device. If you have a SENEC.Home 4, there is no choice - this device is cloud only.

   - SENEC cloud: You need to have an account at mein-senec.de (email + password)
   - Local SENEC device: You need to have a SENEC device in your house that can be reached via LAN

1. Prepare a Linux box (Raspberry Pi, Synology NAS, ...) with Docker installed

2. Make sure your InfluxDB2 database is ready (not subject of this README)

3. Prepare an `.env` file (see `.env.example`)

4. Run the Docker container on your Linux box:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

The Docker image support multiple platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/arm/v7`
